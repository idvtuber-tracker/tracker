## Python packages

Installed via `pip` / `requirements.txt`. These packages are **not bundled**
in this repository; they are downloaded at install time. License obligations
apply if you redistribute them.

| Package | Version | License | Copyright holder |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google-api-python-client` | 2.131.0 | Apache 2.0 | Google LLC |
| `psycopg2-binary` | 2.9.9 | LGPL 3.0 + OpenSSL exception | Daniele Varrazzo and contributors |

### Notes on psycopg2-binary (LGPL 3.0)

`psycopg2-binary` is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
v3.0, with an OpenSSL exception. LGPL requires that if you distribute the
project as a **compiled binary** that statically links psycopg2, users must
be able to relink against a modified version of the library. Because this
project is distributed as Python source and users install psycopg2 via pip,
this condition is automatically satisfied and no additional action is required.

### Notes on Apache 2.0 packages

Apache 2.0 requires that you preserve copyright notices and NOTICE files when
**redistributing** the packages themselves. Because this project does not
redistribute the packages — users install them via pip — no additional action
is required.
